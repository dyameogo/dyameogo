<section><h3 style="text-align:center">Hi my name is Daniel Yameogo a 10th grade student at BCIT westhampon and is a part of the Information Technology shop at BCIT.<br> I am a person that strives to be the best version of my self and is very competetive at everthing I do. I picked the Information <br>Technology sop because I see a future in it. I enjoy playing and watching sports which is where I got my competitiveness from. <br>I see my future being in the IT field and being the best at what I do. I am also a 4.1 gpa student and rank 12 out of the entire <br>sophmore group, but I am aiming to get higher then that and get into the top 5. Another goal is to mantain a 4+ GPA for all for years in <br>high school. </h3></section>
